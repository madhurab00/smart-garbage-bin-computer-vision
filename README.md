## Overview
This project aims to automate waste sorting using a conveyor belt system, computer vision, and IoT. The system classifies garbage into three categories (plastic, paper, organic) and sorts them into respective bins.

## Features
- Real-time garbage classification using computer vision.
- Automatic sorting using servo motors.
- IoT integration for monitoring bin status.
- Website and mobile app for real-time updates.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-garbage-bin.git
   cd smart-garbage-bin
